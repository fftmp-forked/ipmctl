SYNOPSIS

--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Changes the configurable settings on one or more PMem modules.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Changing PMem module settings is a potentially destructive operation which
  requires confirmation from the user for each PMem module. This option suppresses the
  confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Modifies specific PMem modules by supplying one or more comma separated PMem module
  identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it may put the system in an
  undesirable state. The default is to modify all manageable PMem modules.

PROPERTIES
----------
AveragePowerReportingTimeConstant::
  The value, in milliseconds, used to determine the time constant for reporting
  the average power consumption measurements. Can be set to a value between 100
  and 12000, by increments of 100. The default value is 1000.

EXAMPLES
--------
Sets average power reporting time constant multiplier to 1 on all manageable PMem modules.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

* The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

* The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each PMem module, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure
occurs when modifying multiple PMem modules, the process will exit and not continue
modifying the remaining PMem modules.
