NAME
----
ipmctl-show-namespace - Shows information about one or more namespaces

SYNOPSIS
--------
[listing]
--
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -namespace [TARGETS]
--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows information about one or more namespaces.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
  Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
  bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
  terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-namespace [NamespaceIDs]::
  Restricts output to specific namespaces by providing a comma separated list of
  one or more namespace identifiers. The default is to display all namespaces.

-region [RegionIDs]::
  Restricts output to the namespaces on specific regions by supplying the region
  target and one or more comma separated region identifiers. The default is to
  display namespaces on all regions.

EXAMPLES
--------
Shows the default attributes for the specified namespace.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -namespace 0x01
--

Shows all the attributes for all namespaces.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -a â€“namespace
--

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

* The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

* The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software and unlocked if
  security is enabled.

Use the command <<Show System Capabilities>> to retrieve namespace
limitations as reported by the driver.

RETURN DATA
-----------
The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes listed below;
applying options changes the output to a more detailed format.

NamespaceID::
  (Default) The identifier of the namespace

Capacity::
  (Default) The usable capacity of the namespace. This value is the raw namespace capacity, not counting meta data.

HealthState::
  (Default) The rolled-up health of the underlying PMem modules. One of:
  * Unknown
  * Healthy
  * Warning: Indicates a namespace has a non-critical problem. One of:
    - Reporting an LBA size that is unsupported by this driver.
  * Critical: Indicates a namespace has a critical problem. One of:
    - Inconsistent data structures.
    - Mismatch between namespace label and associated PM region.
    - Poison or uncorrectable data in namespace metadata.
    - Namespace label checksum mismatch.
    - Mismatch between number of labels reported by namespace and number of labels found (invalid number of labels found).
    - Namespace parent interleave set not found.
    - Interleave set or region initialization failure (out of memory).
    - PMem module missing (serial number of PMem module from the Platform Config Data not found in the PMem module list).
    - PMem module not configured.
    - Failure to retrieve AppDirect I/O structures from NFIT (system physical address missing).
    - Failure to check existence of address abstraction.
    - Failure to initialize BTT.
    - Failure to initialize PFN.
  * Locked: One or more of the of the underlying PMem modules within the namespace are locked.
  * Unsupported: The namespace type is not supported.

Name::
  The user specified namespace name up to a maximum of 64 characters

RegionID::
  The region from which the namespace was created.

BlockSize::
  The logical size in bytes for compatibility with block read/write operations

Mode::
  Address abstraction type found on the namespace. One of:
  * None (raw)
  * Sector - Powerfail write atomicity is guaranteed via a Block Translation
    Table (BTT).
  * fsdax - Supports filesystem-dax (See ndctl-create-namespace)

NOTE: If the namespace is disabled, mode may be reported as "None".

LabelVersion::
  Indicates the Namespace index version that can be set with
  <<Create Memory Allocation Goal>>. One of:
  * 1.1
  * 1.2

NamespaceUUID::
  UUID of the namespace (raw UUID)
